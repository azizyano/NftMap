## Install

This module uses node.js, and can be installed through npm:

```bash
npm install --save ipfs-http-client
```

### Running the daemon with the right port

To interact with the API, you need to have a local daemon running. It needs to be open on the right port. `5001` is the default, and is used in the examples below, but it can be set to whatever you need.

```sh
# Run the daemon
> ipfs daemon
```
install This module 

```bash
npm install 
```

## Run the app

```bash
npm run start 
```
